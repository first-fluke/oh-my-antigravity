description: Documentation drift detection and sync via `oma-docs`. Verify mode finds broken refs in all repo markdown (default glob `**/*.md`), sync mode proposes patches for docs affected by a git diff, i18n mode surfaces stale translations, and lint mode checks CJK em-dash style plus wrong-language placeholders across all locales.

- **Response language follows `language` setting in `.agents/oma-config.yaml` if configured.**
- Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization, clarification, verification, and completion. Execute required steps on the selected path in dependency order; apply documented branch and skip conditions.
- **Sync is proposal-only unless edits are authorized.** Follow the execution policy: an explicit request to update the scoped docs authorizes those patches; otherwise present proposals and obtain authorization before applying.
- **Never modify `.agents/` definitions.** SSOT protection covers skills, workflows, rules, agents, and config, in all modes. Generated artifacts under `.agents/results/` and `.agents/state/` are not SSOT — never delete them to "restore" protection.
- **Follow the host-LLM contract** in `.agents/skills/oma-docs/SKILL.md`: the CLI emits structured data; this workflow performs natural-language synthesis, severity grouping, and patch drafting on top of the JSON output.

---

> **Vendor note:** This workflow executes inline (no subagent spawning). All vendors invoke `oma docs` directly.

## L1 Decision Events

Emit required L1 decisions by calling `oma state emit` directly, as documented in `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md`.

---

## Step 1: Detect Mode

Inspect the user's request to select a mode:

| Mode | Triggers |
|------|----------|
| `sync` | Prompt mentions `sync`, "동기화", "patch docs", "update docs after change", or supplies a git diff range (e.g. `HEAD~1..HEAD`, `main..feature`). |
| `i18n` | Prompt mentions translation drift, stale/missing translations, "번역 드리프트", "translations out of date". |
| `lint` | Prompt mentions translated-doc style lint, em-dash cleanup, CJK style anti-patterns, or wrong-language placeholders in translations. |
| `verify` | Default. Use when the request is about checking, auditing, or validating docs. |

If intent is ambiguous, ask once:

```
Run `oma docs verify` (drift check) or `oma docs sync` (propose patches for a git diff)?
```

Capture optional arguments from the prompt:
- **verify**: glob path (e.g. `docs/**/*.md`, `cli/README.md`), `--no-urls`, `--urls-sync`, `--report-file <path>`.
- **sync**: git diff range (default: staged, fallback `HEAD~1..HEAD`).
- **i18n**: `--min-severity <CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW>` (default `MEDIUM`).
- **lint**: `--locales <list>` narrows only the CJK em-dash rule (default `ko,ja,zh`); wrong-language placeholder detection still scans every locale.

---

## Step 2: Preflight

1. Confirm `oma` is available: `command -v oma` (or `bun run oma --help` if running from source).
2. For `sync` mode, confirm the repo has a usable diff:
   - If `--cached` returns nothing, fall back to `HEAD~1..HEAD`.
   - If neither is available, ask the user for an explicit range.
3. If `oma docs` is missing entirely, print an install hint and exit. Do NOT silently substitute manual greps.

---

## Step 3A: Verify Mode

Run the deterministic drift check and capture JSON for downstream synthesis:

```bash
oma docs verify --json
```

Variants (apply only the flags the user requested):

```bash
# Narrow scope
oma docs verify "docs/**/*.md" --json
oma docs verify cli/README.md --json

# Persist a full markdown report
oma docs verify --report-file ./drift-report.md

# Skip URL checking (if lychee is unavailable or run separately)
oma docs verify --no-urls --json

# Block until lychee URL check finishes (CI-style)
oma docs verify --urls-sync --json
```

Exit codes:
- `0`: clean.
- `1`: broken refs found in core check (URL drift does NOT affect this exit code; see `docs/generated/url-drift.json`).

---

## Step 3B: Sync Mode

Run candidate-doc lookup against the user-supplied range:

```bash
# Default: staged changes; fallback HEAD~1..HEAD
oma docs sync --json

# Explicit range
oma docs sync HEAD~5..HEAD --json
oma docs sync main..feature-branch --json
```

The CLI emits a list of `{ doc, changedFiles, matchedRefs }` entries. Patch synthesis is your responsibility (host-LLM contract); apply patches only within the authorized edit scope.

---

## Step 3C: i18n / Lint Mode

Both are report-only — the CLI never edits translations.

```bash
# Structural drift between web/docs (EN) and web/i18n/{lang}
oma docs i18n --json --min-severity MEDIUM

# Content-level style anti-patterns in CJK translations
oma docs lint --json
```

Host-LLM contract: prioritize CRITICAL/HIGH drift pairs and hand each to `oma-translation` in diff-sync mode; for lint issues, restructure flagged sentences via `oma-translation` when translation edits are authorized; otherwise report proposals. Never bulk-retranslate.

---

## Step 4: Synthesize Findings (Host-LLM Contract)

### Verify mode

Read the JSON drift report and:

1. Group findings by severity / kind:
   - **CRITICAL**: broken `file` refs in critical paths (CLAUDE.md, top-level READMEs, install docs).
   - **HIGH**: broken `cli`, `script`, `env`, `config` refs anywhere in `docs/`.
   - **MEDIUM**: broken `file` refs in deeper documentation sections.
   - **LOW**: URL drift surfaced in `docs/generated/url-drift.json` (when present).
2. For each finding, suggest a concrete fix (renamed path, missing CLI install, removed env var, etc.).
3. Prioritize fixes for files most central to the project.
4. If the user asks for a natural-language summary, generate it from the JSON, never from cached prose.

### Sync mode

For each candidate doc:

1. Read the doc itself.
2. Read `git diff` for the listed `changedFiles`.
3. Draft a unified-diff patch reflecting the code change. Keep the patch minimal: only update text that the diff actually invalidates.
4. Prepare and present the patches. If scoped edits are already authorized, proceed without another approval. Otherwise use the prompt template for the unresolved patch decision:

   ```
   [y] apply  [n] skip  [d] show diff  [s] show full proposal
   ```

5. Before applying or skipping each patch, emit and verify the required patch approval decision. Substitute the actual doc path, intended action, and authorization source (existing request or new choice); do not emit the literal template:

   ```bash
   oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"docs.sync-patch-approval","decision":"<apply|skip>: <doc path>","rationale":"<existing scoped edit request or new user choice authorizing this action>"}'
   oma state verify --workflow docs --checkpoint sync-patch-approval
   ```

6. Apply authorized patches via `git apply` or by writing the doc directly. After applying the patch batch, regenerate the index once:

   ```bash
   oma docs verify --json > /dev/null
   ```

   (verify always overwrites `docs/generated/doc-refs.json`.)

---

## Step 5: Report

Tell the user:

- Mode executed (`verify` / `sync`).
- Counts: broken refs by kind (verify), candidate docs / applied patches (sync).
- Top 3 actionable items with `file:line` references.
- Pointer to `docs/generated/doc-refs.json` and (if applicable) `docs/generated/url-drift.json`.
- Any skipped checks (e.g. `lychee` missing, LLM unavailable, secret-bearing files excluded).

**Verify report template:**

```markdown
## Docs Verify Report
- Scope: **/*.md repo-wide, or the requested glob (N docs scanned)
- Broken: file=A cli=B script=C env=D config=E
- Top fixes:
  1. <file:line> — <description> → <fix>
  2. ...
- URL drift: see docs/generated/url-drift.json (M flagged)
```

**Sync report template:**

```markdown
## Docs Sync Report
- Range: <range>
- Candidate docs: N
- Applied patches: M (authorized)
- Skipped: K (user declined or no actionable change)
- Index regenerated: docs/generated/doc-refs.json
```

---

## Failure Handling

| Situation | Recovery |
|-----------|----------|
| `oma` not on PATH | Print install hint; exit. Do not fall back to manual grep. |
| `lychee` missing | Print install hint (`brew install lychee`); continue with core check only. |
| `doc-refs.json` stale in sync | Run `oma docs verify --json` first, then re-run sync. |
| LLM unavailable for verify summary | Emit raw JSON drift report and let the user review. |
| LLM unavailable for sync proposals | Emit candidate-list-only output; user reviews matched refs manually. |
| Extractor parse error on a single doc | Skip + warn; continue with remaining docs. |
| `git apply` fails on an approved patch | Show the failure; offer to write the doc directly or skip. |
