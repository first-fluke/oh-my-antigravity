- **Response language follows `language` setting in `.agents/oma-config.yaml` if configured.**
- Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization, clarification, verification, and completion. Execute required steps on the selected path in dependency order; apply documented branch and skip conditions.
- **You MUST use MCP tools throughout the entire workflow.** This is NOT optional.
  - Use code analysis tools (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`) for code exploration. Do NOT use raw grep as a substitute.
  - Use file tools (`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`) to persist coordination artifacts directly to `{memoryConfig.basePath}/` (default: `.agents/state/memories/`). Do NOT use Serena's `write_memory` for workflow session state, as verification gates require durable files on disk.
  - Memory path: configurable via `memoryConfig.basePath` (default: `.agents/state/memories`)
  - Tool names: configurable via `memoryConfig.tools` in `.agents/mcp.json`
- **This workflow does NOT stop until all completion criteria pass or safeguards trigger.**
- **Follow the context-loading guide.** Read `.agents/skills/_shared/core/context-loading.md` and load only task-relevant resources.

## Vendor Detection

Before starting, determine your runtime environment by following `.agents/skills/_shared/core/vendor-detection.md`.
The detected vendor determines how ultrawork spawns agents internally.

---

## Phase 0: INIT (DO NOT SKIP)

### Step 0.1: Load Prerequisites

1. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/core/context-loading.md` for resource loading strategy.
2. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/memory-protocol.md` for memory protocol.
3. Read `.agents/workflows/ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md` for JUDGE rules.
4. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md` for the L1 event protocol and `oma state emit` (used by the EXEC checkpoint in Step 1.2).

### Step 0.2: Define Completion Criteria

Analyze the user's request and define **verifiable** completion criteria. Each criterion MUST have:

```markdown
criteria:
  - id: C{N}
    description: "<what to achieve>"
    verification: "<how to verify — test result, non-emitting check, file existence, command output>"
    status: PENDING
    fail_count: 0                   # updated once per JUDGE by judge-protocol.md
    previous_status: null           # last non-null status from prior iteration
    regressed_at_iteration: null    # iteration number when PASS → FAIL transition was detected
    affected_paths: []              # optional glob list — only set when verification takes >30s
                                    # used by judge-protocol's cache rules; see judge-protocol.md § "Caching for Heavy Verification"
```

**Rules:**
- Ground every criterion in a mechanically verifiable check (test assertion, non-emitting type check, exit code, file existence). Include a build/compile/package command only when the user explicitly requested a build, per the shared execution policy.
- Lock criteria directly into session memory and output them in the execution trace; proceed immediately to Step 0.3 and Phase 1 without halting for interactive confirmation (Ralph is an autonomous persistent execution loop)

### Step 0.3: Initialize Session

1. Generate a `sessionId` (`{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}` timestamp). All ralph memory files for this run are session-scoped with this suffix, per memory-protocol session-scoped naming. Never write to an unsuffixed `session-ralph.md` — consecutive ralph runs must not overwrite each other.
2. Set `max_iterations: 5` (default safeguard)
3. Set `current_iteration: 0`
4. **Load prior-session context** (cross-session memory):
   1. Use the memory list tool to find previous `session-ralph-*.md` files. If any exist, read the most recent one and extract: final criteria statuses, BLOCKED items with their failure evidences, and any safeguard trigger.
   2. If `lessons-learned.md` exists in the memory base path, read it.
   3. If any current criterion overlaps a previously BLOCKED item, carry the prior failure evidence as context for EXEC and retry unless explicitly excluded by the user request.
5. Record session start using memory write tool:
   - Create `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md` in the memory base path
   - Include: session start time, user request summary, completion criteria, max_iterations, and prior-session findings loaded in step 4 (or `none`)

---

## Phase 1: EXEC

### Step 1.1: Prepare Ultrawork Input

Compose the ultrawork input based on current iteration:

- **Iteration 1**: Full user request with all PENDING criteria
- **Iteration 2+**: REMAINING (FAIL + REGRESSED) criteria from previous JUDGE result, with:
  - Previous JUDGE results as context (what failed and why)
  - Suggested actions from JUDGE
  - Already-PASSED criteria excluded from **implementation scope** (do not re-implement), but they remain in **JUDGE scope** (will be re-verified to detect regressions)

### Step 1.2: Execute Ultrawork

**EXEC-entry checkpoint (MANDATORY — emit before delegating).** This records, in the auditable L1 event log, that this iteration delegates to the full ultrawork workflow. A run without this event is a non-compliant run.

```bash
oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"ralph.exec-delegated","decision":"Delegate this iteration to the full ultrawork 5-phase workflow.","rationale":"Ralph EXEC must run ultrawork in full; abridging, substituting, or skipping phases for cost/stability/time reasons is forbidden without explicit user approval."}'
oma state verify --workflow ralph --checkpoint exec-delegated
```

Delegate to the ultrawork workflow:

1. Read and follow `.agents/workflows/ultrawork.md` step by step.
2. Pass the prepared input as the task description, **and pass this ralph run's `sessionId` as ultrawork's session id**. Ultrawork must save `plan-{sessionId}.json` and all `result-*-{sessionId}.md` artifacts under ralph's id — otherwise the Step 1.3 verifier (`oma ralph verify --session-id {sessionId}`) cannot match them.
3. Ultrawork handles all vendor-specific agent spawning internally.
4. Wait for ultrawork to complete all 5 phases (PLAN, IMPL, VERIFY, REFINE, SHIP).
5. **Do NOT abridge ultrawork.** If you believe the environment (subagent instability, cost, time) warrants reducing fan-out or collapsing phases, STOP and ask the user first. Single-judgment substitution of ultrawork's structure is forbidden — see the Anti-Circumvention gate in Step 1.3.

### Step 1.3: Verify EXEC Artifacts (Anti-Circumvention Gate)

**Prose instructions ("run ultrawork in full") are advisory and can be rationalized away. This gate verifies the work mechanically — by its artifacts, not by your own narration.** Ultrawork's 5 phases each leave a durable trace; a single-agent shortcut cannot produce them without actually doing the work.

Run the deterministic verifier from the repo root:

```bash
oma ralph verify --json --session-id {sessionId} --newer-than {iteration_start_iso}
```

- `--session` scopes the plan artifact to this iteration's session id; `--newer-than` (this iteration's EXEC start time, ISO-8601) excludes stale artifacts from earlier iterations. Supply both for repeated iterations; missing identity cannot prove an iteration.
- The command checks the artifact table below, prints a structured result (`ok`, `checks`, `missing`, `remediation`), and exits non-zero on failure. On failure it also appends a `gate.failed` L1 event automatically.
- **The JSON verdict IS the gate result.** Do NOT substitute your own narration for it, and do NOT proceed on a non-zero exit.
- If the CLI is unavailable, report the gate as unverified. File existence cannot substitute for execution evidence. Resolve `{memBase}` from `memoryConfig.basePath` (default `.agents/state/memories`).
- Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/result-contract.md`: QA and REFINE receipts must match this session and a task ID in the plan, include successful checks for the current working tree, and bind the report, plan and phase log by content hash.

| # | Artifact | Proves phase ran |
|---|----------|------------------|
| A1 | `{memBase}/session-ultrawork.md` with this iteration's phase-completion records | PLAN + gate progression |
| A2 | `.agents/results/plan-{sessionId}.json` | PLAN produced a real task breakdown |
| A3 | `{memBase}/result-qa*.md` or `.agents/results/result-qa*.md` (VERIFY) | **a distinct QA agent ran** — absent if IMPL was the only spawn. CLI fallback writes `result-qa-agent*` to `{memBase}`; Claude-native `qa-reviewer` writes `result-qa*` to `.agents/results/` |
| A4 | `{memBase}/result-refactor*.md` or `.agents/results/result-refactor*.md` (REFINE) | **a distinct Refactor agent ran** — same naming split (`refactor-engineer` on the native path). Legacy `result-debug*` from older runs is also accepted |

**Decision:**

- **`ok: true` (exit 0)** → the required local execution evidence is current. Proceed to Step 1.4.
- **`ok: false` (exit 1, `missing` non-empty)** → treat EXEC as **NOT performed** (the iteration was abridged to implementation-only, regardless of what the EXEC narration claims). Do NOT advance to JUDGE as if work completed. Instead:
  1. Record the violation in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md`: `exec-circumvention detected at iteration {N}: missing {artifact}`.
  2. Emit the audit event:
     ```bash
     oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"ralph.exec-circumvention","decision":"EXEC artifacts incomplete — ultrawork did not run in full.","rationale":"Required VERIFY/REFINE agent result files are absent; the iteration was abridged."}'
     ```
  3. Report the missing or stale evidence, repair the authorized work, and retry the gate. Apply `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md`; ask only when repair needs a material missing decision or new authorization. Do NOT retry with the same missing evidence.

> **REFINE skip exception**: ultrawork permits skipping REFINE for trivial tasks (< 50 lines, see ultrawork `REFINE_GATE` skip conditions). If REFINE was legitimately skipped, A4 may be absent — but `session-ultrawork.md` MUST record the documented skip reason. "No A4 and no recorded skip reason" is a circumvention, not a skip. `oma ralph verify` implements this rule: a recorded skip reason reports A4 as `skip-recorded` (passing), an unrecorded absence reports `missing` (failing).

### Step 1.4: Record EXEC Completion

1. Increment `current_iteration`
2. Use memory edit tool to record EXEC completion for iteration `{current_iteration}` in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md`

---

## Phase 2: JUDGE

### Step 2.1: Independent Verification (Spawned Judge)

**The judge is a separate agent with fresh context — not a role the orchestrator plays.** The orchestrator that drove EXEC shares context with the implementation and cannot self-judge without rationalization risk. Spawning is the default; inline judging is a recorded exception.

1. **Compose the judge brief.** It contains ONLY:
   - The current criteria snapshot: id, description, verification method, status, previous_status, fail_count, regressed_at_iteration, affected_paths, and prior verification evidence
   - The verification cache records from `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md` (if any)
   - The required output format (Step 2.2) and a pointer to `.agents/workflows/ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md`
   - Do NOT include EXEC narration, implementation summaries, or any claim about what was fixed. The judge verifies what IS, not what was intended.
2. **Spawn the judge via Per-Agent Dispatch** (see Vendor Detection):
   - **If Claude Code and target vendor is Claude**: `Agent(subagent_type="qa-reviewer", prompt="<judge brief>. Follow .agents/workflows/ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md. Follow the protocol's verification and cache rules and write the JUDGE result to memory as result-judge-{sessionId}-iter{N}.md.")`
   - **Otherwise, or when native dispatch is unavailable**: `oma agent spawn qa-agent "<judge brief>" {sessionId}`
   - Verification is mechanical (run command, check exit code/output) — a lower-cost model tier is acceptable where the runtime supports per-agent model selection.
3. **Wait for `result-judge-{sessionId}-iter{N}.md`**, then read it as the JUDGE result.
4. **Inline fallback (exception)**: only if subagent spawning is unavailable in the current runtime, perform the verification inline. Record `judge-inline-fallback at iteration {N}` in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md` and emit:
   ```bash
   oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"ralph.judge-inline-fallback","decision":"Run JUDGE inline in the orchestrator context.","rationale":"Subagent spawning unavailable in this runtime; judge independence is downgraded for this iteration."}'
   ```

Apply [Verification Execution Order](ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md#verification-execution-order), including prior PASS criteria, and its heavy-verification cache rules. The judge uses the shared execution policy when selecting or executing checks.

### Step 2.2: Produce JUDGE Result

The judge writes [JUDGE Result Format](ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md#judge-result-format), the updated criterion state, and [Remaining Items](ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md#remaining-items-on-fail-verdict) when required. Status transitions and verdict computation are defined only in that protocol.

### Step 2.3: Apply JUDGE Result

Validate the returned evidence and state against [Criterion State Transitions](ralph/resources/judge-protocol.md#criterion-state-transitions), then persist the result in session memory. The judge applies the transition once; the coordinator must not increment counters or apply it again. If the result is inconsistent, return it to the judge for correction against the original snapshot.

---

## Phase 2 → Decision Gate

Evaluate the JUDGE result:

### → DONE (All criteria PASS or BLOCKED)

If all criteria are either PASS or BLOCKED:

1. **If any BLOCKED exists**: Report partial completion with BLOCKED items listed
2. **If all PASS**: Report full completion
3. Use memory edit tool to record final results in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md`
4. Output completion summary:
   ```
   ## Ralph Complete — Iteration {N}/{max}

   PASSED: C1, C2, ...
   BLOCKED: C3 (if any)

   Total iterations: {N}
   ```
5. Workflow ends.

### → REPLAN (Any criterion is FAIL or REGRESSED)

If any criterion has status FAIL or REGRESSED, proceed to Phase 3.

### → SAFEGUARD (max_iterations reached)

If `current_iteration >= max_iterations`:

1. Force stop regardless of FAIL criteria
2. Report partial completion:
   ```
   ## Ralph Safeguard — Max Iterations Reached ({max})

   PASSED: C1, ...
   FAILED: C2, ... (still unresolved)
   BLOCKED: C3, ... (if any)

   Recommendation: Review FAILED criteria manually or increase max_iterations.
   ```
3. Use memory edit tool to record safeguard trigger in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md`
4. Workflow ends.

---

## Phase 3: REPLAN

### Step 3.1: Extract Remaining Work

From the JUDGE result, collect criteria with status `FAIL` or `REGRESSED`. Treat the two classes separately:

1. **FAIL** (first-time or persistent failures): list each with its reason and suggested_action
2. **REGRESSED** (previously PASS, now FAIL): list each with previous-pass iteration, the inter-iteration diff that likely caused the regression, and a regression-specific suggested_action.
3. Include previous iteration's JUDGE evidence as context
4. Explicitly state which criteria are PASS (do not re-implement, but do not exclude from next JUDGE either)
5. Explicitly state which criteria are BLOCKED (do not retry)

### Step 3.2: Narrow Scope

Compose a focused task description containing the remaining work, separating regressions from first-fail items so ultrawork's reasoning differs:

```markdown
## Ralph Iteration {N+1} — Remaining Work

### Already Complete (DO NOT re-implement; will be re-verified by JUDGE)
- C1: <description> PASS

### Blocked (DO NOT retry)
- C3: <description> BLOCKED (failed 3x)

### Regressed (was passing — diagnose what broke it; minimal fix that preserves recent changes)
- C4: <description>
  - Last passed at: iteration {N}
  - Failed at: iteration {current}
  - Files changed since last pass: <list of modified paths>
  - Failure evidence: <evidence>
  - Suggested action: diff-aware diagnosis — identify which change in the listed files broke C4, fix that specifically without reverting the criterion that change was made for

### To Fix (first-time or persistent failures)
- C2: <description>
  - Previous failure: <evidence>
  - Suggested action: <action>
```

**Why separate Regressed from To Fix**: ultrawork prompts that frame work as "fix from scratch" vs "diagnose a regression" produce different reasoning paths. Regressed items should trigger diff-based investigation, not greenfield re-implementation.

### Step 3.3: Loop Back

1. Use memory edit tool to record REPLAN in `session-ralph-{sessionId}.md`
2. Return to **Phase 1: EXEC** with the narrowed scope
