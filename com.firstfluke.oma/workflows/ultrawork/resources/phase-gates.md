# Phase Gate Definitions

This file is the canonical definition of gate criteria, score thresholds, and skip conditions. Each phase must pass its gate or record an applicable skip before proceeding. `ultrawork.md` owns dispatch, phase logs, decision checkpoints, and retry limits.

Apply `../../../skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization and verification. Existing authorization satisfies approval requirements; ask only for a material missing decision or new authorization. SHIP checks readiness; publishing or deployment requires authorization for that action.

The "Owner" of each gate coordinates the phase and records the verdict; it does **not** review its own phase inline. The review-type criteria below (completeness, alignment, safety, reusability, consistency, quality, cascade, final) are assessed by fresh, context-isolated reviewer subagents per the **Cross-Context Review (CCR) Dispatch** section of `ultrawork.md` and the CCR Mandate in `multi-review-protocol.md`. On a repeated gate failure, re-review with a fresh reviewer context — adding more same-context passes does not recover the gap.

## PLAN_GATE

**Owner**: PM Agent
**Trigger**: After Steps 1-4

### Criteria
- [ ] Plan documented with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Where set, `test_approach` is valid (`tdd|test_after|not_applicable`); every `not_applicable` carries `test_approach_rationale` + `alternative_verification`; refactor tasks are never `tdd` (see `_shared/core/test-approach.md`)
- [ ] Assumptions explicitly listed
- [ ] Alternatives considered for architecture decisions (min 2)
- [ ] Over-engineering review completed
- [ ] Scope authorized under the execution policy

### Auto-pass Conditions
These conditions allow gate bookkeeping to proceed once the required reviews and criteria above are satisfied; they do not skip review steps.

- Difficulty: Simple
- Existing pattern match
- User explicitly skips

### Failure Action
Revise plan, do not proceed to IMPL

---

## IMPL_GATE

**Owner**: Implementation Agent
**Trigger**: After Step 5

### Criteria
- [ ] Applicable non-emitting checks pass; build/compile/package checks run only when the user explicitly requests a build
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Tasks marked `test_approach: tdd` have a `TDD_EVIDENCE` block (focused test command, RED failure, GREEN pass) in the result — checked **only** for `tdd` tasks; `oma verify <agent>` automates this
- [ ] Only planned files modified
- [ ] No unrequested features added
- [ ] Diff reviewed for scope creep
- [ ] (If measured) Baseline Quality Score recorded in Experiment Ledger

### Auto-pass Conditions
These conditions do not waive the criteria above or any later review.

- All tests green
- Diff < 200 lines
- No new dependencies

### Failure Action
Fix issues, re-run implementation

---

## VERIFY_GATE

**Owner**: QA Agent
**Trigger**: After Steps 6-8

### Criteria
- [ ] Implementation matches requirements
- [ ] Zero CRITICAL issues
- [ ] Zero HIGH issues
- [ ] Improvements validated (no regressions)
- [ ] (If measured) Quality Score meets the threshold in Quality Score Integration

### Blockers
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH issue

### Failure Action
Return to IMPL with findings

---

## REFINE_GATE

**Owner**: Implementation + Refactor Agents
**Trigger**: After Steps 9-13

### Criteria
- [ ] No files > 500 lines (or justified)
- [ ] No functions > 50 lines (or justified)
- [ ] Integration opportunities captured
- [ ] Side effects verified
- [ ] Unused code cleaned
- [ ] (If measured) Quality Score >= Post-VERIFY score (no regression from refinement)

### Score Recovery (when measured)
If delta from Post-VERIFY is below -5, discard the refinement changes and record the experiment. A smaller negative delta still fails the no-regression criterion: repair or discard it before passing the gate, then refresh affected checks.

### Skip Conditions
- Simple tasks < 50 lines total change
- User explicitly skips

### Failure Action
Address issues, re-verify

---

## SHIP_GATE

**Owner**: QA Agent
**Trigger**: After Steps 14-17

### Criteria
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Test coverage >= 80% (hard floor — no task's `test_approach`, including `not_applicable`, waives or lowers it)
- [ ] UX flows verified
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Migrations safe
- [ ] Related issues addressed
- [ ] Deployment checklist complete

### Final Approval
Reuse existing authorization under the execution policy. Ask only for an unresolved material decision or an action outside that authorization; readiness review itself does not require another approval.

### Quality Score Requirement (when measurement is available)
- [ ] Final composite score meets the threshold in Quality Score Integration
- [ ] Score delta from IMPL baseline >= 0 (no regression)
- [ ] Experiment Ledger summary recorded

### Failure Action
Return to appropriate phase based on failure type

---

## Quality Score Integration

Gates from IMPL through SHIP incorporate the Quality Score when measurement is available (see `quality-score.md`).
Quality Score is loaded **conditionally** per `context-loading.md`, not at Phase 0.

When a score is available, it supplements the checklist:
- **Grade A (90-100)**: Gate passes only if all checklist items are also met
- **Grade B (75-89)**: Gate passes only if all checklist items are also met, with noted improvements for next phase
- **Grade C (60-74)**: Gate FAILS; must improve score before proceeding
- **Grade D (0-59)**: Hard FAIL; rollback required

When no measurement tools are available, gates fall back to the binary checklist above.

### Repeated Gate Failure Rule

If the same gate **fails twice** on the same issue:
- Load `exploration-loop.md` (conditional loading, see `context-loading.md`)
- Activate the **Exploration Loop** (see `exploration-loop.md`)
- Generate 2-3 alternative hypotheses
- Experiment and select the highest-scoring approach
- Resume gate evaluation with the winning approach
