- **Response language follows `language` setting in `.agents/oma-config.yaml` if configured.**
- Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization, clarification, verification, and completion. Execute required steps on the selected path in dependency order; apply documented branch and skip conditions.
- **You MUST use MCP tools throughout the entire workflow.** This is NOT optional.
  - Use code analysis tools (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`) for code exploration. Do NOT use raw grep as a substitute.
  - Use file tools (`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`) to persist coordination artifacts directly to `{memoryConfig.basePath}/` (default: `.agents/state/memories/`). Do NOT use Serena's `write_memory` for workflow session state, as verification gates require durable files on disk.
  - Memory path: configurable via `memoryConfig.basePath` (default: `.agents/state/memories`)
  - Tool names: configurable via `memoryConfig.tools` in `.agents/mcp.json`
- **Read the oma-coordination skill BEFORE starting.** Read `.agents/skills/oma-coordination/SKILL.md` and follow its Core Rules.
- **Follow the context-loading guide.** Read `.agents/skills/_shared/core/context-loading.md` and load only task-relevant resources.

## Agent execution evidence

Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` and `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/result-contract.md`. Include QA and REFINE task IDs in the plan. For each native agent, begin a run, record checks, and finalize its structured result. For CLI dispatch, pass `--task-id` and use the injected run identity. Complete phase logs before finalizing the QA/REFINE artifacts; code changes after verification require fresh checks.


## Vendor Detection

Before starting, determine your runtime environment by following `.agents/skills/_shared/core/vendor-detection.md`.
The detected runtime vendor and each agent's target vendor determine how agents are spawned (Step 4) and monitored (Step 5).

---

## Step 0: Preparation (DO NOT SKIP)

1. Read `.agents/skills/oma-coordination/SKILL.md` and confirm Core Rules.
2. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/core/context-loading.md` for resource loading strategy.
3. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/memory-protocol.md` for memory protocol.
4. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md` for L1 event protocol.
5. Emit required L1 decisions by calling `oma state emit` directly, as documented in `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md`.
6. Generate a session ID (format: `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss`). It keys `plan-{sessionId}.json` and all session-scoped memory artifacts (`progress-*-{sessionId}.md`, `result-*-{sessionId}.md`).
7. Record session start using memory write tool:
   - Create `session-work.md` in the memory base path
   - Include: session start time, session ID, user request summary.

---

## Step 1: Analyze Requirements

Analyze the user's request and identify involved domains (frontend, backend, mobile, QA).

- Single domain: suggest using the specific agent directly.
- Multiple domains: proceed to Step 2.
- Use MCP code analysis tools (`get_symbols_overview` or `search_for_pattern`) to understand the existing codebase structure relevant to the request.
- Report analysis results to the user.

---

## Step 2: Run PM Agent for Task Decomposition

Activate PM Agent to:

1. Analyze requirements.
2. Define API contracts.
3. Create a prioritized task breakdown.
4. Save plan to `.agents/results/plan-{sessionId}.json`.
5. Use memory write tool to record plan completion.

---

## Step 3: Review Plan with User

Present the PM Agent's task breakdown to the user:

- Priority tiers (1, 2, 3 — lower runs first)
- Agent assignments
- Dependencies
- Apply `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md`: proceed when the requested work or decision is already authorized; ask only for a material missing decision or new authorization.

---

## Step 4: Spawn Agents by Priority Tier

Spawn agents for each task by priority tier (lowest first: tier 1, then tier 2, etc.).
Spawn all same-priority tasks in parallel. Assign separate workspaces to avoid file conflicts.

### Per-Agent Dispatch
Resolve the target vendor for each agent from `.agents/oma-config.yaml`.
Use native subagents only when `target_vendor === current_runtime_vendor` and that runtime supports the vendor's role-subagent path.
Otherwise use `oma agent spawn` for that agent.

### If Claude Code and target vendor is Claude
Use the Agent tool to spawn subagents:
- `Agent(subagent_type="backend-engineer", prompt="Implement backend tasks per plan.", run_in_background=true)`
- `Agent(subagent_type="frontend-engineer", prompt="Implement frontend tasks per plan.", run_in_background=true)`
- Multiple Agent tool calls in the same message = true parallel execution
- Agent definitions: `.claude/agents/{agent}.md`

### If Codex CLI and target vendor is Codex
Spawn native Codex custom agents using `.codex/agents/{agent}.toml` when available.
Native CLI executor path: `codex exec "@{agent} ..."` using the generated agent file.
Pass each agent its task description, API contracts, and relevant context.
If native dispatch is not verified in the current runtime, fall back to `oma agent spawn`.

### If Gemini CLI and target vendor is Gemini
Use native Gemini subagents when available, otherwise fall back to `oma agent spawn`.
Native CLI executor path: `gemini -p "@{agent} ..."` using `.gemini/agents/{agent}.md`.

### If target vendor differs from current runtime, or native dispatch is unavailable
```bash
oma agent spawn backend "task description" session-id -w ./backend &
oma agent spawn frontend "task description" session-id -w ./frontend &
wait
```

---

## Step 5: Monitor Agent Progress

- Use memory read tool to poll `progress-{agent}[-{sessionId}].md` files
- Use MCP code analysis tools (`find_symbol` and `search_for_pattern`) to verify API contract alignment between agents
- Use memory edit tool to record monitoring results

> **Claude Code note**: the Agent tool returns results synchronously (or notifies on background completion), so no file polling is needed. Check status, files changed, and issues directly in each agent's return value.

---

## Step 6: Run QA Agent Review

After all implementation agents complete, spawn QA Agent to review all deliverables:

- Security (OWASP Top 10)
- Performance
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Code quality

---

## Step 6.1: Measure Quality Score (Conditional)

If automated measurement is available:
1. Load `quality-score.md` (conditional, per `context-loading.md`)
2. Measure Quality Score based on QA findings
3. Record as baseline in Experiment Ledger via memory tools

---

## Step 7: Address Issues and Iterate

If QA finds CRITICAL or HIGH issues:

1. Re-spawn the responsible agent with QA findings. **The fix prompt MUST instruct root-cause remediation, not symptom suppression.** Forbid tactical patches (try/catch swallowing, validation bypass, hardcoded values, feature flags hiding the bug, silencing the failing test) unless the agent can explicitly justify why a structural fix is out of scope for this iteration (e.g., upstream library bug, deprecated path, hotfix window). Bias toward the orthodox engineering fix even when it costs more lines or touches more files.
2. Emit and verify the remediation decision before accepting any fix/ignore choice:
   ```bash
   oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"work.remediation-choice","decision":"Fix the responsible QA finding with root-cause remediation or explicitly defer it.","rationale":"QA identified a CRITICAL/HIGH issue requiring a recorded remediation choice."}'
   oma state verify --workflow work --checkpoint remediation-choice
   ```
3. If Quality Score is active: measure after fix, apply Keep/Discard rule, record in Experiment Ledger.
4. Before each new fix cycle, apply the loop termination check:

   > **Fix Loop termination conditions** (OR, whichever fires first wins):
   > 1. Total fix cycles have reached the configured maximum (default: 5). Do not start another cycle; report the remaining CRITICAL/HIGH findings and stop.
   > 2. Session cost cap exceeded: if `loadQuotaCap()` from `cli/io/session-cost.ts` returns non-null, call `checkCap(sessionId, cap)` (no cap configured → skip this condition). If `exceeded === true`, print `formatPromptMessage(result)` to the user and stop the loop immediately. Save current results before stopping, then report early termination due to quota.
   >
   > If neither condition is met, repeat Steps 5-7.

5. **If same issue persists after 2 fix attempts**: Activate **Exploration Loop** (load `exploration-loop.md` per `context-loading.md`):
   - Generate 2-3 alternative approaches via Exploration Decision template
   - Re-spawn the same agent type with different hypothesis prompts (separate workspaces)
   - QA scores each result
   - Best result adopted, others discarded
   - All experiments recorded in Experiment Ledger
6. Continue until all critical issues are resolved or a termination condition fires.
7. Use memory write tool to record final results.
8. If Quality Score was measured: generate Experiment Ledger summary and auto-generate lessons from discarded experiments.

---

## Step 8: Optional Doc Verify Hook

If `oma-config.yaml` has `docs.auto_verify: true`:

1. Run `oma docs verify --json` from the repo root.
2. Capture the JSON output.
3. If `broken.length === 0`: print `docs verified clean (N docs)` summary to stdout and continue with workflow completion.
4. If `broken.length > 0`: print a 1-3 line summary identifying which docs have drift, and a hint `Run /oma-docs verify for the full report.` Continue with workflow completion (warn-only, never block).
5. If `oma-docs` is not available (CLI command missing): skip silently.

This hook is opt-in; the default `auto_verify: false` skips this step entirely.
