# oh-my-agent

Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization, clarification, verification, and completion. System/developer instructions and the user's request take precedence over OMA defaults. Never build, compile, bundle, or package software unless the user explicitly requests a build.

- **SSOT**: Do not modify `.agents/` definitions (skills, workflows, rules, agents, config) directly. Run outputs under `.agents/results/` and `.agents/state/` are generated artifacts and may be written.
- **Response language**: Follow `language` in `.agents/oma-config.yaml`.
- **Skills**: Read the relevant `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` when needed.
- **Subagents**: Same-vendor native dispatch via Codex custom agents in `.codex/agents/{name}.toml`; cross-vendor fallback via `oma agent spawn`

## Per-Agent Dispatch

Resolve each agent from `.agents/oma-config.cue` or `.agents/oma-config.yaml`. Explicit `agents:` overrides take priority. With `model_preset: auto`, follow the current vendor's native agent/model settings; use `default_cli` only when the runtime is unknown. Use native subagents when the target matches the current runtime; otherwise, or when native dispatch is unavailable, use `oma agent spawn`.

## Code Search

Serena MCP is required for code search and discovery. Load deferred tools before use. Use native search/read only when Serena is unavailable or times out, or for plain non-code content.

## Workflows

Run workflows only when explicitly requested or detected by a hook; never self-initiate. Read and follow `.agents/workflows/{name}.md`. Continue active workflows until complete or explicitly cancelled.
