/**
 * Git `commit-msg` guard for `Co-authored-by:` trailers.
 *
 * oma instructs agents to append a `Co-authored-by:` trailer, and agents compose
 * commit messages as literal text. A model can therefore emit the address from
 * memory and get it wrong even with the correct value in context. That mistake
 * is not inert: GitHub resolves a co-author address against verified account
 * emails and credits whoever owns it as a repository contributor. The
 * attribution then survives a history rewrite, because `refs/pull/*` keeps the
 * original commits reachable for the lifetime of the repository — the only
 * remedies left are a support ticket or deleting the repository.
 *
 * Prose in a skill file cannot prevent a typo. A `commit-msg` hook can, and it
 * covers every vendor at once because git enforces it below the agent.
